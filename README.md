# Hey! 👋 I'm Dani

Software Engineer and fullstack developer with 5+ years building stuff on the internet. Currently working at **Teledyne FLIR** doing frontend R&D (embedded systems, thermal camera interfaces, that kind of thing) while juggling freelance projects on the side where I do a bit of everything.

Finishing my Software Engineering degree at **Universidad Politécnica de Madrid** while working full-time because, apparently, I enjoy pain 😅

## 🧠 What Drives Me

I'm passionate about **doing things right**. I don't settle for "it works" – I want it well-written, scalable, robust, and built to last. I love spending time on the small details because that's what separates mediocre software from exceptional software.

I'm a restless soul: I'm interested in a bit of absolutely everything. **AI, cybersecurity, software architecture, quantum computing, blockchain**... If it's tech and it's new, I'm probably poking around.
